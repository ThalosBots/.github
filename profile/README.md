# üó°Ô∏è Thalos Bots üó°Ô∏è

*Short and quick*üëã  
We are a group on independent developers that get together to test-out the state of art and develop fun projects, along-side professional software products.

## How to contribute?

Our workstyle follows the principles described [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgV6M1LyfNY&t=301s) by `No Boilerplate`

1. **Github repo as ONLY source of truth**:
   After going though all productivity tools availables phases: Notion, JIRA, Obsidian...
   We came to the conclusion that tools only needed 2 characteristics to be productivity friendly:

   - Just enough tooling/indicators, not too much, not too few
   - Everything related to a project must be avaible in the same space
     Admin overhead and _JIRA syndrom_ was definetly killing our motivation, so just keep

2. **Only ONE repo per project**: Following the previous step, if all the information must be available in the same space, you should not considering splitting the repo into multiple.

**Internally**, we belive in `Internal OpenSource` as making all the content contribuitable for every member of the organization
